# Crossfit Portmarnock

This project was created thing about a traditional Crossfit Gym, where people can get fit, does not matter their age or how fit they are at the moment. 
I also want to highlight all benefits that the place’s facilities offers to your members and their families. As CrossFit is a sport that is much nicer if you practice with many friends, we can not forget to mention our promo “if you bring a friend you have 10% of discount”.

### Bring a friend and get 10% of discount:

“Get a discount” always calls people attention, for this reason I decided to add this very small sentence over the main photo of our website. This way people will get curious about “how does it work?” and consequently, ask for more details.

### Facilities:

In this session I decided to make a very direct propaganda about the facilities that the gym can offer to the members. This way we can easily can people’s attention to something that is not offered by most of our competitors in the market.

The very simple time table was created to show all possible future members and also to the ones who are already registered with us what time they can join the available classes.

### Mini Gallery:

In our mini gallery we can see different people, exercises and also equipments that usually you will see in a CrossFit gym. It is very important to show how CrossFit is a very dynamic activity and someone difficultly will get bored after a couple of months practicing this modality.
